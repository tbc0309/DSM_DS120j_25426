<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>On the <b>Performance</b> page, you can monitor resource usage on both active and passive servers side by side.  The two servers can be easily distinguished by the server name and the respective roles (active or passive). When the passive server is powered off, resource usage on the passive server will not be displayed.</p>

<h3>CPU</h3>
<p>You can check the overall CPU usage by the system, users, and I/O queue. After you open the page, the CPU load may be higher because the system is loading the page while gathering system usage information at the same time.</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>Overall usage of the physical memory will be displayed. If memory usage remains high, it may be because the system stores frequently-used data in the cache to access data quickly, without having to access the disk. When overall memory is insufficient, the system will release cache memory.</p>

<h3>Network</h3>
<p>The network traffic graph displays data transfer rate in KB per second, with different colors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Blue represents upload rate.</li>
		<li>Green represents download rate.</li>
		<li>When upload and download rates overlap, the overlapping area will be dark green.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Disk</h3>
<p>The graph displays the overall disk usage.</p>
