<h2><a name="leaf_update"></a>DSM Update</h2>
<p>Periodically, Synology releases free DSM updates. Updates may include new features, function improvements, and performance enhancements. DSM updates may be in the form of minor or major updates. The system displays a message next to <b>Status</b> if the update is minor. When there are major DSM version releases, there will be a section under <b>Status</b> providing information about this release as well as a download link to the major update version. Generally, minor updates include critical bug fixes and security patches for system stability; while major updates mainly include brand-new features and performance enhancement, in addition to critical bug fixes and security patches.</p>

<h4>To set up check schedule:</h4>
<p>The <b>Check schedule</b> lets you decide when the system should check for available updates. Select which days of the week and the time of day on the specified days to check for updates. For example, on Tuesdays and Fridays at 11:00.</p>
