<h1>Application Portal</h1>
<p>Application Portal allows you to configure the connection settings of various applications so that you can directly access and run these applications (e.g. File Station) in independent browser tabs or windows.</p>


<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>You can edit access settings for applications like Audio Station, Download Station, Surveillance Station, Video Station, File Station, and many others.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2><a name="session"></a>Customize Aliases</h2>

<p>You can assign an alias for each Synology-developed application like File Station. With the custom alias, you can quickly open the application via a specialized URL.</p>

<h4>To customize application aliases:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Application Portal</strong> &gt; <strong>Application</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some applications have their default aliases: Audio Station (<strong>audio</strong>), Download Station (<strong>download</strong>), File Station (<strong>file</strong>), Surveillance Station (<strong>cam</strong>), and Video Station (<strong>video</strong>).</li>
<li>Alias names cannot be the same as those reserved for system, browsers, or used by other applications, and their number of characters must be limited within 2 to 20. </li>
<li>An alias can only be made up of mixed case letters, numeric characters, and two special characters (-) and (_).</li>
<li>An alias cannot start or end with either special character (-) or (_).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>To access applications with aliases:</h4>
<p>After you set up an alias for an application (e.g. File Station), you can quickly open the application by entering a URL in the following formats: <code>http://DS_IP_OR_SERVER_NAME/ALIAS/</code> or <code>https://DS_IP_OR_SERVER_NAME/ALIAS/</code></p>

<p>For instance, you can quickly access File Station via the URLs: <code>http://192.168.xx.xx/file/</code> or <code>https://MySynologyNAS/file/</code></p>


<h2><a name="session"></a>Customize HTTP/HTTPS Ports</h2>

<p>You can assign an HTTP/HTTPS port for each Synology-developed application like File Station. With the custom port, you can quickly open the application via a specialized URL.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h4>Note:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The range of port number can be from 1 to 65535.</li>
  <li>The following ports cannot be used because they are reserved for system use:
  <ul>
  <li>20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 110, 137, 138, 139, 143, 199, 443, 445, 515, 543, 548, 587, 873, 993, 995, 3306, 3689, 5000, 5001, 5005, 5006, 5335, 5432, 6881, 8080, 7000, 7001, 8081, 9997, 9998, 9999, 50001, 50002</li>
  <li>eMule default ports: 4662 (TCP), 4672(UDP)</li>
  <li>FTP default port range: The actual range may vary depending on different models.</li>
  
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>


<h4>To access applications with HTTP/HTTPS ports:</h4>

<p>After you set up HTTP/HTTPS ports for an application (e.g. File Station), you can quickly open the application by entering URLs in the following formats: <code>http://DS_IP_OR_SERVER_NAME:HTTP_PORT</code> or <code>https://DS_IP_OR_SERVER_NAME:HTTPS_PORT</code></p>

<p>For instance, you can quickly access File Station via the URLs: <code>http://192.168.xx.xx:7000</code> or <code>https://MySynologyNAS:7001</code></p>

<h4>To configure the certificate and TLS/SSL profile level for HTTPS ports:</h4>
<p>After you set up an HTTPS port for an application (e.g. File Station), you can go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Security</strong> > <strong>Certificate</strong> and click <strong>Configure</strong>. Then find the service name in the format of <strong>Application_Name - HTTPS_PORT</strong> to configure the certificate used.</p>
<p>Also, you can go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Security</strong> > <strong>Advanced</strong> and click <strong>Custom Settings</strong>. Then find the service name in the format of <strong>Application_Name - HTTPS_PORT</strong> to configure the TLS/SSL profile level used.</p>
<p>For instance, if the HTTPS port of File Station is 7001, you can go to the two setting pages mentioned above and find the service under the name of FileStation - 7001 for further configuration.</p>

<h2><a name="session"></a>Customize Domains</h2>

<p>You can match a domain name with a Synology-developed application like File Station. With the custom domain, you can quickly open the application via a specialized URL.</p>

<h4>To customize application domains:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Application Portal</strong> &gt; <strong>Application</strong>.</li>
<li>Select an application.</li>
<li>Click <b>Edit</b> > <strong>General</strong>.</li>
<li>In the pop-up window, select <b>Enable customized domain</b>.</li>
<li>Specify a custom domain.</li>
<li>For additional settings, you can select <strong>Enable HSTS</strong> or <strong>Enable HTTP/2</strong> to suit your needs.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Before setting up this feature, you need to apply for domain names from domain providers so that users can access the service from the Internet.</li>
<li>Each domain name can only be used for one distinct application on your Synology NAS.</li>
<li>If the domain name does not exceed 15 characters in length and complies with the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/909264" target="_blank">NetBIOS naming conventions</a>, the system will register and broadcast the domain name automatically.</li>
<li>When you access applications via URLs that use domain names, you will go through the standard HTTP port (80) or the standard HTTPS port (443).</li>
<li>If you enable access control with certificate that is issued by Let's Encrypt, it may lead to certificate auto renew failure. If this situation happens, please disable access control first. Then, go to <b>Control Panel</b> &gt; <b>Security</b> &gt; <b>Certificate</b>, right-click one of the Let's Encrypt certificates you would like to renew and choose <b>Renew certificate</b>. After renewing certificate, you can re-enable access control.  </li>
</ul>

</div>


<h4>To access applications via domains:</h4>
<p>After you set up a domain (e.g. file.example.com) for an application (e.g. File Station), you can quickly open the application by entering a URL in the following formats: <code>http://APP_DOMAIN</code> or <code>https://APP_DOMAIN</code></p>

<p>For instance, you can quickly access File Station via the URLs: <code>http://file.example.com</code> or <code>https://file.example.com</code></p>

<p>If the domain name (e.g. FileFile) for an application (e.g. File Station) obeys the NetBIOS naming conventions, Windows users can access it on a Synology NAS in the same local network with a similar URL: <code>http://FileFile</code> or <code>https://FileFile</code></p>

<h4>To configure the certificate and TLS/SSL profile level for domains:</h4>
<p>After you set up a domain for an application (e.g. File Station), you can go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Security</strong> > <strong>Certificate</strong> and click <strong>Configure</strong>. Then find the service name in the format of <strong>Application_Name - Domain</strong> to configure the certificate used.</p>
<p>Also, you can go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Security</strong> > <strong>Advanced</strong> and click <strong>Custom Settings</strong>. Then find the service name in the format of <strong>Application_Name - Domain</strong> to configure the TLS/SSL profile level used.</p>
<p>For instance, if the domain of File Station is file.example.com, you can go to the two setting pages mentioned above and find the service under the name of FileStation - file.example.com for further configuration.</p>

<h4>To specify an access control profile:</h4>
<p>After you set up an access control profile for an application (e.g. File Station), denied users will not able open the application by entering the specified URLs mentioned in this article.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Application Portal</strong> &gt; <strong>Application</strong>.</li>
<li>Select an application.</li>

<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the settings.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Customize Reverse Proxy Rules</h2>
<p>Your Synology NAS can act as a reverse proxy server that transfers requests from the Internet to devices in the local network. Reverse proxy rules can help you hide sensitive ports from potential threats as in the two scenarios below:</p>

<p>Scenario 1: Suppose the sensitive port is 80, which should not allow external access according to the firewall rule. You can set up a reverse proxy rule to allow trusted users from the Internet to reach the sensitive port 80 via another open port (e.g. 81). In this way, the trusted users can circumvent the firewall  and still be able to access the port 80.</p>

<p>Scenario 2: Suppose the sensitive port is 80, which should not allow external access except from a specific device (e.g. a server named "MyTrustee"). With reverse proxy rules, you can allow only traffic from MyTrustee to reach the port 80 while traffic from other devices will not.</p>

<h4>To set up reverse proxy rules:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Application Portal</strong> &gt; <strong>Reverse Proxy</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Create</strong> and specify the following settings in the <b>General</b> page:
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Specify a name that helps you identify the rule function.</li>
<li>Specify the rules for the <strong>Source</strong> (the device sending requests from the Internet) and <strong>Destination</strong> (the device in the local network):
<ul>
<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: The <strong>HTTP</strong> or <strong>HTTPS</strong> protocols used by the source/destination</li>

<li><strong>Hostname</strong>: The name of the source/destination device</li>
<li><strong>Port</strong>: The port used by the source/destination device</li>
<li><strong>Enable HSTS</strong> and <strong>Enable HTTP/2</strong> (only for the source)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To specify an access control profile, click <strong>Enable access control</strong> and select an access control profile. For more information on how to create an access control profile, refer to <a href="#acl">Customize Access Control Profiles</a> below.</li></li>
    
<div class="section">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Click <strong>WebSocket</strong> from the <strong>Create</strong> drop-down menu to fast create WebSocket function header to let reverse proxy support WebSocket.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
  

<li>To adjust reverse proxy's other behavior, please go to <b>Advanced Settings</b> page.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Proxy connection timeout (sec.)</b>: Set the proxy time limit of connection to target server.</li>
    <li><b>Proxy send timeout (sec.)</b>: Set the proxy time limit of request being sent to target server.</li>    
    <li><b>Proxy read timeout (sec.)</b>: Set the proxy time limit of waiting for target server to response.</li>  
    <li><b>Proxy HTTP version</b>: Select the HTTP verison that is used to communicate between proxy server and target server.</li>        
    <li><b>Use the error page sent back by target server</b>: When target server senting back error HTTP code, it will show target server's web error page after this option is ticked. Otherwise, it will show Synology NAS error page.</li>
    </ul>
       
    
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the settings.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="acl"></a>Customize Access Control Profiles</h2>

<p>If you want to restrict user access to Application Portal or reverse proxies according the user's source IP, you can create an access control profile. Denied users will see an access denied page.</p>

<h4>To create an access control profile:</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Application Portal</strong> &gt; <strong>Access Control Profile</strong>.</li>
 <li>Click <strong>Create</strong>. In the pop-up window, you can customize the rules in this new profile.</li>
 <li>Click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new rule. The rules will be applied according to top to bottom priority, determining the access permissions.</li>
 <li>Double click on a rule to edit it. To delete rules, select them and click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
 <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the rule list as a new profile.</li>
 <li>Click on the name field of the profile to rename it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If you leave the source hostname blank, the rule will be applied to all sources.</li>
	<li>If you enable access control with certificate that is issued by Let's Encrypt, it may lead to certificate auto renew failure. If this situation happens, please disable access control first. Then, go to <b>Control Panel</b> &gt; <b>Security</b> &gt; <b>Certificate</b>, right-click one of the Let's Encrypt certificates you would like to renew and choose <b>Renew certificate</b>. After renewing certificate, you can re-enable access control.  </li>
	<li>If you want to apply whitlisting, you need to set up rules about denied sources, besides creating rules about allowed sources, to activate the rules. <br/>For instance, if only <code>http://192.168.xx.xx</code> is allowed, you need to 
	<ol>
	<li>Add <code>http://192.168.xx.xx</code> as the allowed source.</li>
	<li>Add a new rule and set it as "Deny".</li>
	</ol>
	
</ul>
