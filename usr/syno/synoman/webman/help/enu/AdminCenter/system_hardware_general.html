<h2>General</h2>

<p><strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Hardware &amp; Power</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> provides options to enable power recovery and Wake on LAN (WOL). You can also modify beep control, fan speed mode, and LED brightness here.</p>

<h3>Memory Compression</h3>
	<p>You can enable Memory Compression to improve general system responsiveness under load by compressing the least recently used data in memory.</p>
	<p>When you have multiple applications running and the memory begins to fill up, the dynamic Memory Compression shrinks the size of seldom-used items in memory, minimizing memory usage. When the items are needed again, they can be instantly uncompressed. This reduces the need to read and write memory swap files on disk, improving efficiency and responsiveness.</p>
	<p>To enable Memory Compression, simply tick the checkbox.</p>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Memory Compression is available on specific models only. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.synology.com/" target="_blank">Synology website</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h3>Power Recovery</h3>
<p>If the system shuts down due to unexpected power failure, the power recovery function allows the system to boot up automatically once power has been restored.</p>

<h3>Wake on LAN</h3>
<p>Enabling Wake on LAN (WOL) allows you to turn on your Synology NAS over local area network or the Internet by entering the IP address (or DDNS hostname) and the MAC address of your Synology NAS using a WOL application, such as Synology Assistant, DS finder or any other WOL applications.</p>

<p>Wake on LAN works only after the Synology NAS is shut down properly by pressing the physical <b>Power</b> button or clicking <b>Shutdown</b> on the DSM interface. Keep the power cord plugged into a working power outlet after shutdown.</p>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>WOL is available on specific models only. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.synology.com/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General/Which_Synology_DiskStation_supports_WOL_Wake_on_LAN" target="_blank">Synology website</a>.</li>
	<li>WOL is not supported on 10GbE LAN ports (if available on your Synology NAS).</li>
	<li>On RC18015xs+, WOL is by default enabled on 1GbE LAN ports for Synology NAS, and cannot be disabled.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Fan Speed Mode</h3>
<p>The following fan speed options are available:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Full-Speed Mode:</strong> Fan operates at full speed, keeping the Synology NAS cooler, but producing more noise.</li>
	<li><strong>Cool Mode:</strong> Fan operates at higher speed, keeping the Synology NAS cooler, but producing more noise.</li>
	<li><strong>Quiet Mode:</strong> Fan operates at lower speed, producing less noise, but the Synology NAS might become warmer.</li>
	<li><strong>Low-Power Mode:</strong> Fan operates at lower speed, producing less noise, but the Synology NAS might become warmer. In addition, when the Synology NAS is cool, the fan will stop in order to save power. Low-power mode is only available on specific models.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Fan-related configuration is not available on a fan-less model, such as EDS14. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.synology.com/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General/What_type_of_fan_speed_modes_are_available_on_my_Synology_NAS" target="_blank">Synology website</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Beep Control</h3>
<p>Synology NAS can emit a beeping sound when certain events or errors occur. Click the checkboxes of listed events to allow Synology NAS to alert you when errors occur.</p>

<h4>To stop the beeping sound:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If the Synology NAS is beeping, click the <strong>Beep off</strong> button to deactivate it. </li>
</ul>



<h3>LED</h3>
<p>At <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Hardware &amp; Power</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>LED Brightness Control</strong>, you can adjust brightness of the LED indicators on your Synology NAS.</p>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>LED configuration is available on specific models only. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.synology.com/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General/Which_Synology_DiskStation_supports_LED_brightness_adjustment" target="_blank">Synology website</a>.</li>
	<li>The brightness settings are applied to all LED indicators on your Synology NAS (i.e. Power, STATUS, LAN, drive status, and so on).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>To adjust LED brightness:</h4>
<p>Four brightness levels are now available for the LED indicators on your Synology NAS.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click and drag the pointer on the brightness scale in either direction:
		<ul>
			<li>Rightward: Increase LED brightness.</li>
			<li>Leftward: Decrease LED brightness.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to save the setting.</li>
</ol>

<h4>To adjust LED brightness by schedule:</h4>
<p>The LED indicators  can change their brightness level in the scheduled time.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click <strong>Set Schedule</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click either brightness type below:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Default brightness</strong>: The fullest brightness</li>
			<li><strong>Adjusted brightness</strong>: The brightness level specified on the brightness scale</li>
			<li><strong>Off</strong>: LED off</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click on the desired periods to customize the brightness schedule.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Apply</strong> to save the settings.</li>
</ol>
