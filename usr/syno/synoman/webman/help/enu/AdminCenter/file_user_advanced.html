<h2>Advanced User Settings</h2>

<p>To modify advanced user settings, you can go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>User</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong>. The options below are available. </p>

	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to save settings.</li>
	<li>The link marked "Forgot your password?" will display on the DSM login page. Once the password is forgotten, the user can click this link and enter the username. In this case, the system will send this user an email containing a link to reset the forgotten password.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Before enabling this option, make sure you have already enabled SMTP email notifications. To do so, go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Notification</strong>.</li>

	<li>Users who belong to the <strong>administrators</strong> group cannot reset passwords with this option.</li>
	<li>Domain users cannot reset passwords with this option.</li>
	<li>LDAP users can reset passwords with this option, as long as the Synology NAS serves as the LDAP directory server and satisfies the following conditions:

			<li>The final Provider must be accessible with the user's web browser, and its email notifications must be enabled.</li>
			<li>To avoid the reset forgotten password link from being used by someone else, the link must be clicked from the identical IP address where the forgotten password request has been made.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

			<li><strong>Minimal password length</strong>: The password must be at least the value specified in the text field. The  length should be a number between 6 and 127.</li>

<h3>2-Step Verification</h3>
<p>2-step verification provides improved security for DSM user accounts. You can force DSM administrators or all DSM users to enable their 2-step verification in order to further protect their accounts.</p>

<h4>To enforce 2-step verification for DSM users:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Tick the <strong>Enforce 2-step verification for the following users</strong> box, and select which users you want to apply this to.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to save settings.</li>
	<li>With this enforcement applied, users that have not enabled their 2-step verification will be asked to finish the settings before they can log in to DSM.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If you have not yet configured 2-step verification at <strong>Personal</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong>, the 2-step verification setup wizard will be launched to help you complete the required settings before you can apply this enforcement.</li>
	<li>Disabling 2-step verification enforcement here will not affect or disable the 2-step verification settings of each user. Users can keep their 2-step verification settings, or go to <strong>Personal</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> to disable these settings.</li>
	<li style="display: none;">2-step verification also applies to all SSH-related services, such as SSH terminal, SFTP, and rsync with SSH transfer encryption. However, since Hyper Backup and Shared Folder Sync via rsync with SSH transfer encryption do not support 2-step verification, these two services will not be able to work normally after 2-step verification is enabled.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3>User Home</h3>

<p>Enable user homes to create a personal <strong>home</strong> folder for each user, except for <strong>guest</strong>. All users can access their own home folder via CIFS, AFP, FTP, or File Station.</p>

<p>Users belonging to the <strong>administrators</strong> group can access all personal folders located in the <strong>homes</strong> default shared folder. The name of home folder is the same as the user account.</p>

<h4>To enable the user home service:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Check <strong>Enable user home service</strong>.</li>
	<li>If there are multiple volumes, select where you want the <strong>homes</strong> folder to be stored.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Once the local user home service is disabled, the domain user home service will also be disabled concurrently.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>To disable the user home service:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Uncheck <strong>Enable user home service</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to save settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the user home service is disabled, the <strong>homes</strong> shared folder will be preserved for administrator access.  Users will be able to access their home folders again when  the user home service is enabled again.</p>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>To delete the <strong>homes</strong> shared folder, user  home service must be disabled first.</li>
	<li>The domain user home service would be disabled if the local user home service is disabled.</li> 
</ul>
