<h2>Edit a User</h2>
<p>Find the user account (by entering the user name in the Search field), double click on it or click <b>Edit</b>, and then you can edit its account data.</p>

<span class="note_head">Note:</span><ol>
<li>If you disable an account, the account will stop functioning.</li>

<li><b>Quota</b> should be an integer greater than or equal to 0, and less than the disk/volume capacity. A quota value of 0 means <b> Effective quota</b> will be determined by <strong>Group Limit</strong>.</li>

<li>If there is more than one volume/shared folder on the server, you can set a quota for the user on every volume/shared folder</span>.</li>
<li>Email information on the &quot;Notification&quot; page must be set correctly in order for the system to notify the user by email after the account information has been created or modified.</li>
<li>When setting speed limit for a user, you will see numbers under <strong>Result</strong> if there is already a group speed limit applied to the user.
<li>The speed limit assigned to a user will not be included in the speed limit of the group that the user belongs to.
</ol>

<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Editing quota is not supported by EDS14 or DDSM.</li>
<li>Only VDSM and models with the following package architectures support editing a group's usage quota through shared folder: Apollo Lake, Avoton, Braswell, Broadwell, Bromolow, Cedarview, and Grantley. To see which package architecture your model supports, please refer to <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have" target="_blank">this article</a>.</li>
