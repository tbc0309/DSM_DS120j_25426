<h2>Email</h2>

<p>Enabling email notifications allows the Synology NAS to send messages to your email when specified events occur, such as system errors, network connection loss, fan behavior,  power failure, or backup task failure.</p>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The event of fan behavior is not available on a fan-less model, such as EDS14. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.synology.com/" target="_blank">Synology website</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>To enable email notifications:</h4>

	<li>If necessary, add a subject prefix in the <strong>Subject prefix</strong> field. This prefix will be added to the subject of each message sent by the Synology NAS, thus helping you identify and filter messages.</li>
	<li>If you want to use a third-party email server (e.g. Gmail or Outlook) to relay messages, see the &quot;third-party email service&quot; section below. If you want to use a custom server, please see the &quot;custom SMTP server&quot; section. </li>
</ol>
