<h2>Login Analysis</h2>
<p>Login analysis allows system administrators to check security information on the current system and accounts.</p>

<p>You can disable login analysis or edit the rules at <b>Security Advisor</b> > <b>Advanced</b> > <b>Customize checklist</b>.</p>

<h4>New login activities</h4>
<p>Security Advisor analyzes each user's login information including HTTP user-agent, IP address, and geographic location. When a new login activity is detected, Security Advisor will send a notification to the system administrator and the user in question.</p>
<p>Once it is confirmed that a specific login record is abnormal, it is strongly advised to use a stronger password, enable 2-step verification, or even limit allowed IPs to enhance account security.</p>

<h4>Password guessing (brute force attacks)</h4>
<p>Security Advisor analyzes failed login attempts across different IPs and protocols. When someone tries to log in by trying passwords but fails too many times, Security Advisor will send a notification to the system administrator and the user in question. The system administrator can enhance account security by enabling <b>Auto Block</b> or <b>Account Protection</b> (at <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Security</b> > <b>Account</b>).</p>
