<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Click on <strong>Performance</strong> tab to view the resource utilization data. Detailed date, time and information of the chart will be shown upon mouseover.</p>
<p>On the Overview tab, charts for <strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>GPU</strong>, <strong>System Memory</strong>, <strong>GPU Memory</strong>, <strong>Network</strong>, <strong>Disk</strong>, <strong>Volume</strong>, and <strong>iSCSI</strong> are displayed.</p>

<h3>CPU</h3>
<p>You can see the overall CPU usage of <strong>User</strong>, <strong>System</strong> and <strong>I/O Wait</strong>. CPU load could be high when Resource Monitor is first launched, because the system needs to collect its resource data and load the UI page at the same time.</p>
<ul><li><strong>User</strong> shows the percentage of CPU used to run user applications.</li>
<li><strong>System</strong> shows the percentage of CPU used in the core of the system, hardware/software IRQs.</li>
<li><strong>I/O Wait</strong> shows the percentage of CPU spent on I/O wait.</li>
<li><strong>Utilization</strong> is the sum of <strong>User</strong> and <strong>System</strong> CPU usage.</li>
<li>The Load Average within 1, 5, and 15 minutes is displayed, showing the run-queue length (i.e. the sum of the number of processes that are currently running plus the number that are waiting to run). </li>
</ul>
<div class="section">
<h4>Term Explanation</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>I/O wait</b>: I/O wait indicates that the CPU is idle and not being used by any program. </li>
<p>I/O wait is a normal behavior. Since the speed of CPU is far faster than that of I/O, it is common for CPU to wait for the transmission of disks or network to complete. However, if the percentage of I/O wait is extremely large, it means that the CPU spends most of the time on I/O wait and might not be well utilized. You can use more efficient disk group configurations (e.g. SHR or RAID 5) or network configurations (e.g. Bonding) to achieve better system performance.</p> 
</ul>
</div>

<h3>GPU</h3>
<p>The overall GPU utilization will be shown. You can switch between <strong>GPU</strong> and <strong>GPU Memory</strong> in the drop-down menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utilization</strong> is the sum of <strong>User</strong> and <strong>System</strong> GPU usage.</li>
<li>Under GPU Memory, you can view <strong>Memory Composition</strong> by <strong>Used</strong> and <strong>Free</strong> spaces.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Available only on models which support GPU.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>System Memory</h3>
<p>The overall memory usage of physical memory and swap space will be shown. Memory usage remains high because the system stores frequently accessed data in cache, so the data can be quickly obtained without accessing the hard disk. Cache memory will be released when overall memory is insufficient.</p>
<p>High swap space usage indicates insufficient system memory, and will also affect the system performance. You can view the rate of swap in and swap out by choosing <strong>Swap</strong> from the drop-down menu on the top. </p>

<h3>Network</h3>
<p>The network flow chart displays sent and received data in KB's per second. If PPPoE is connected, its transfer rate will also show up on the chart.</p>

<h3 class="disable-dockerx64">Disk</h3>
<p class="disable-dockerx64">You can choose to view the overall disk utilization, transfer rate or IOPS by clicking the drop-down menu at the top of the chart. You can click <strong>View All</strong> at the bottom to select more disks by ticking the checkboxes to add their data to the chart.</p>


<h3 class="disable-eds14 disable-dockerx64">Volume</h3>
<p class="disable-eds14 disable-dockerx64">This page displays the overall transfer status of volumes. Click the drop-down menu above the chart to view transfer utilization, transfer rate, or IOPS. Click the <strong>View All</strong> button to select individual volumes and add them to the chart.</p>

<h3 class="disable-eds14 disable-dockerx64">iSCSI</h3>
<p class="disable-eds14 dixable-dockerx64">This page displays the overall status of currently running iSCSI LUNs. Click the drop-down menu above the chart to select a LUN and view its status. Three charts are displayed by default, which are <strong>Throughput</strong>, <strong>IOPS</strong> and <strong>Latency</strong>. For more detailed information, click the <strong>Choose Charts</strong> button to select other charts that you want to view.</p>
