<h3>Performance Alarm Rules</h3>

<h4>To create a performance alarm rule:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Settings</strong> and make sure you have ticked <strong>Enable performance alarm</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Performance Alarm Rules</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Create</b> button.</li>
<li>The following rule settings are available:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource</strong>: Choose the resource you want to apply the rule to.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: Choose the type of rule you would like to create.</li>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: Choose the alarm level.</li>
<li><strong>Greater than</strong>: Set the maximum percentage of your rule type where the system will notify you if it is exceeded.</li>
</ul>
<li>Tick <strong>Enable</strong> if you want to enable this rule immediately.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to add the rule.</li>
</ol>


<div class="section">
<h4>Mechanism for performance alarms:</h4>
<p>Performance alarms will operate through the following mechanism to minimize false alarms and to prevent excessive consumption of system resources within a short period of time.</p>
<ol>
	<li>The performance alarm service will check all rules every five minutes. No action will be triggered if all of the monitored values fall below the thresholds that you have set.</li>
	<li>When a monitored value exceeds its threshold, an alarm will not be triggered immediately. Instead, the system will check the rule five more times at 30-second intervals.</li>
	<li>After the change of the interval length, if the monitored value exceeds the threshold five consecutive times, an alarm will then be triggered; if, however, the monitored value falls below the threshold during any of these five checks, the interval length will be changed back to five minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, for one single event, an alarm will at latest be triggered 450 seconds after the first detection of the event.</p>

<h4>Alarm levels:</h4>
<p>Performance alarms will trigger different actions depending on the alarm levels.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Warning</strong>: Generates a warning message in the system log but will not trigger any system notification.</li>
	<li><strong>Critical</strong>: Not only generates a message in the system log but also triggers system notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logs of performance alarms can be viewed at the <strong>Performance Alarm</strong> tab or DSM's <strong>Log Center</strong>.</p>
