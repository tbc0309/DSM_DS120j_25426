<h2>Repair a Storage Pool</h2>

<p>Storage pool errors may occur due to various reasons, such as crashed drives. In certain cases, you can follow the instructions below to diagnose and fix the errors.</p>
	
<p>The <strong>Repair</strong> feature mentioned in this article is only available for storage pools with RAID types that support data redundancy (i.e., SHR comprising at least 2 drives, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID F1, and RAID 10). Please note that this feature can repair a storage pool, but cannot repair defective drives.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We recommend using drives in the <a href="https://www.synology.com/compatibility" target=blank>Synology Products Compatibility List</a> to prevent any issues. Using incompatible drives may affect system performance and even result in data loss.</li>
<li>SHR (Synology Hybrid RAID) is available on specific models only. Please refer to <a href="https://www.synology.com/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Storage/Which_models_have_limited_support_for_Synology_Hybrid_RAID_SHR" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on SHR.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Repair a Degraded Storage Pool</h4>

<p>A storage pool becomes <strong>Degraded</strong> when it cannot access the data on a drive, but data loss has not occurred yet. This only occurs to storage pools with RAID types that provide data redundancy (i.e., SHR comprising at least 2 drives, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID F1, and RAID 10). Before starting to repair a degraded storage pool, please replace the defective drives with healthy drives first and then remove the defective drives, or simply replace them with healthy drives.</p>

<h4>Drive requirements:</h4>
<p>Please replace the defective drives with healthy drives matching the following criteria:</p>
	
<ul>
<li><b>For RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID F1, and RAID 10 storage pools</b>: The size of the replacement drive must be equal to or larger than the size of the smallest drive in the storage pool.</li>
<li><b>For SHR-1 storage pools</b>: The replacement drive must meet one of the following criteria.
<ul>
<li>The size of the replacement drive must be equal to or larger than the size of the defective drive.</li>
<li>With the largest drive in the storage pool excluded, the size of the replacement drive must be equal to or larger than the size of the largest remaining drive.
<br><span class="note_head">Examples:</span>
<ul>
<li>Example 1: SHR-1 is composed of 3TB, 2TB, 2TB, and 1TB drives. If the 3TB drive becomes defective, it can be repaired by a drive with a size that is equal to or larger than 2TB.</li>
<li>Example 2: SHR-1 is composed of 4TB, 4TB, 2TB, and 2TB drives. If the 4TB drive becomes defective, it can be repaired by a drive with a size that is equal to or larger than 4TB.</li>
<li>Example 3: SHR-1 is composed of 4TB, 4TB, 2TB, and 2TB drives. If the 2TB drive becomes defective, it can be repaired by a drive with a size that is equal to or larger than 2TB.</li>
</ul>	
</li>
			
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>For SHR-2 storage pools</b>: The replacement drive must meet one of the following criteria.
<ul>
<li>The size of the replacement drive must be equal to or larger than the size of the defective drive.</li>
<li>With the two largest drives in the storage pool excluded, the size of the replacement drive must be equal to or larger than the largest remaining drive.</li>
</ul>	
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the available drives have been assigned as hot spare drives to protect one or more storage pools, then the hot spare drives will repair the degraded storage pools automatically. Please refer to <a href="hotspare.html" target="_blank">Hot Spare</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h4>To repair a degraded storage pool:</h4>

<p>Please follow the steps below to repair a degraded storage pool:</p>	
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Storage Manager</strong> > <strong>Storage Pool</strong> and find the storage pool in <strong>Degraded</strong> status.</li> 
<img style="display:none;" src="../../../online_img/dsm/StorageManager/storage_pool_repair/volume_degraded.png" class="help_image"/>
<li>View the storage pool information and check the drive status.</li>
<li>Afterward, go to the <strong>HDD/SSD</strong> page to confirm which drive is defective.</li>
<img style="display:none;" src="../../../online_img/dsm/StorageManager/storage_pool_repair/hdd_ssd.png" class="help_image"/>

<li>Remove the defective drive from your Synology NAS and replace it with a new one. If your Synology NAS does not support hot-swapping, please power off your device before removing and installing any drives.<br><span class="note_head">Note:</span> All existing data on the replacement drive will be erased.</li>
<li>After the replacement drive has been installed, return to the <strong>Storage Pool</strong> page and select the degraded storage pool.</li>
<li>Click <b>Repair</b> from the <b>Action</b> drop-down menu.</li>
<img style="display:none;" src="../../../online_img/dsm/StorageManager/storage_pool_repair/manage_repair.png" class="help_image"/>
<li>Select the replacement drive that you want to add to the storage pool, and follow the wizard to finish.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If repairing a storage pool takes a long time, it may be associated with the reasons listed <a href="https://www.synology.com/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Storage/Why_does_it_take_a_long_time_to_repair_a_storage_pool" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

<h3>Troubleshoot Crashed Storage Pools</h3>

<p>When the status of a storage pool becomes <strong>Crashed</strong>, you can no longer repair it by yourself. Please refer to the following articles for more information on the common volume crash reasons and the troubleshooting method:
