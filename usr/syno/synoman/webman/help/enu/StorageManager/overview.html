	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Overview displays the overall status of your storage spaces, including the overall health of all spaces, volume status, storage pool status, and drive information.</p>

		<h4>Storage Health</h4>
        <p>There are three types of status:</p>
	  	<ul>
				<li><b>Healthy</b>: All storage spaces (volume or storage pool) are normal.</li>
				<li><B>Attention</B>: A storage space (volume or storage pool) has become degraded, SSD Cache has crashed, or a system partition has failed.</li>
				<li><b>Danger</b>: A storage space (volume or storage pool) has crashed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If multiple abnormalities occur at the same time, health status will be displayed in the following order: 1) Storage spaces (volume or storage pool); 2) SSD Cache; and 3) system partition. If a problem occurs, please follow the suggested instructions below the status.</p>
		
		<h4>Storage Pool Selector</h4>
	<p>The storage pool selector lists all the storage pools. Select a storage pool to view its details.</p>
		
		<h4>Volume Status</h4>
	<p>This section displays the used capacity of volumes in the selected storage pool. If the total usage reaches the volume critical value, the pie chart will become red; over the warning value, it will be orange; otherwise, it will remain blue. The critical and warning values can be changed at <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Notification</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> &gt; <strong>Internal Storage </strong> &gt; <strong>Volume full</strong>.</p>
		
	<h4>Storage Pool / Storage Allocation</h4>
	<p>When no specific storage pool is selected, the details of all the storage pools are shown. When a specific storage pool is selected, the details and storage allocation of the specific storage pool is shown.</p>
		
		<h4>Drive Info</h4>
        <p>This section displays drive and hardware information. You can check how many drives are being used by what storage spaces, the number of spare drives, and the number of available drive slots.</p>
