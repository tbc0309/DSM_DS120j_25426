<h2>Storage Pool</h2>

<p>One or more drives can be aggregated into a single storage unit called a storage pool, which can be protected by RAID. Different RAID types offer different levels of data protection. For a general list of RAID types supported by your Synology NAS, please refer to <a href="general.html">General</a>. After a storage pool has been created, you can create one or multiple volumes on it. A volume is a unit of data storage and may be expanded if the associated storage pool contains allocatable space. At least one volume must be created before you can start storing data on your Synology NAS.</p>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We recommend using drives in the <a href="https://www.synology.com/compatibility?search_by=category&category=hdds&p=1" target=blank>Synology Products Compatibility List</a> to prevent any compatibility issues. Using incompatible drives may lower the system performance and even cause data loss.</li>
	<li>A storage pool must be comprised of drives of the same type. That is, a storage pool cannot be created with a mix of SATA and SAS drives.</li>
	<li>For Synology NAS models supporting the RAID Group, a <b>RAID 5</b>, <b>RAID 6</b>, or <b>RAID F1</b> storage pool with multiple-volume support may contain multiple <b>RAID arrays</b>. Every RAID array belonging to the same storage pool will be of the same RAID type (e.g., RAID 5, RAID 6, or RAID F1). The maximum number of drives for each RAID array can be 6, 12, or 24. You can set the maximum number of drives while creating the storage pool, and the number cannot be modified later. When a RAID array has been assigned with the maximum number of drives, the next drive added to the storage pool may be assigned to a new RAID array. The new RAID array must contain the minimum number of drives required for that specific RAID type (i.e., three drives for RAID 5 and RAID F1, and four drives for RAID 6).</li>
	<li>If you want to use a certain drive to create a storage pool but the drive did not appear in the <strong>Storage Pool Creation Wizard</strong>, please go to the <strong>HDD/SSD</strong> page to check the drive status.</li>
