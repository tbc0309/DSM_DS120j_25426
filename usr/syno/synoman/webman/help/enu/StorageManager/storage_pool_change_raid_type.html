<h2>Change the RAID Type of a Storage Pool</h2>

<p>Storage pools can be changed from one RAID type to another without losing existing data. For example, you can create a RAID 1 storage pool on your Synology NAS and later change it to RAID 5 if you install more drives. This article provides instructions on changing the RAID type of existing storage pools on your Synology NAS. Before you start changing the RAID type of a storage pool, please refer to the <b>Drive Requirements</b> and <b>RAID Type Requirements and Limitations</b> sections below for details on the relevant requirements and limitations.

<h3>Drive Requirements</h3>

<p>To change the RAID type of a storage pool, you must have a sufficient number of available drives installed in your Synology NAS. Please refer to the table below for the minimum number of drives required for each RAID type.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="50%">RAID Type</th>
    <th width="50%">Minimum Number of Drives Required</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RAID 1</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RAID 5</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RAID 6</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  
   <tr>
    <td>SHR-2</td>
    <td>4 or 5 (depending on the drive configuration of SHR-1)</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</p>
<h3>RAID Type Requirements and Limitations</h3>

<p>Only certain RAID types can be changed to other RAID types. For example, RAID 1 can be changed to RAID 5, but RAID 5 cannot be changed to RAID 1. Please refer to the table below for details.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Current RAID Type</th>
    <th width="30%">Possible Conversion Target Type</th>
    <th width="40%">Additional Number of Drives Required</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Basic</td>
    <td>RAID 1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Basic</td>
    <td>RAID 5</td>
	  <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RAID 1</td>
    <td>RAID 5</td>
	  <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RAID 5</td>
    <td>RAID 6</td>
	  <td>1</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>SHR-1</td>
    <td>SHR-2</td>
	  <td>1 or 2 (depending on the drive configuration of SHR)</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<li>A SHR-1 storage pool with the following drive configurations may require two additional drives when changed to a SHR-2 storage pool:
<ul>
<li>The storage pool contains only two drives.</li>
<li>All drives have different capacities.</li>
<li>In a RAID Array comprising three or more drives, the capacity of the two largest drives are larger than that of the other drives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certain models do not support changing a RAID 5 storage pool to a RAID 6 storage pool.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Change the RAID Type</h3>

<h4>Before you start:</h4>
<p>Before changing the RAID type, please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the status of your storage pool is <b>Healthy</b>.</li>
<li>When adding new drives to a storage pool, the new drives must be larger than the smallest drive in the storage pool and all drives must be of the same drive type.</li>
<li>The RAID type of RAID Arrays in a RAID Group cannot be changed. The RAID Group feature is available on specific models only.<br><span class="note_head">Note:</span> Please go to <a href="https://www.synology.com/products" target="_blank">this web page</a> and tick the upper-right checkbox of your Synology NAS and also that of any other models, and then click the <b>Compare</b> button on the bottom-right corner. Whether your model supports RAID Group will be shown in the <b>Comparison results</b> web page.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>

<ul>
<li>We recommend using drives in the <a href="https://www.synology.com/compatibility" target=blank>Synology Products Compatibility List</a> to prevent any issues. Using incompatible drives may affect the system performance and even result in data loss.</li>
</ul>
