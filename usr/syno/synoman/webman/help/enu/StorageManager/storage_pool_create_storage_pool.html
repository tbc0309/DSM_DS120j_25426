<h2>Create a New Storage Pool</h2>
<div class="section"><h4>Important:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Before you start, make sure there is no important data on the drives that the storage pool is going to be created on. All existing data will be deleted during the creation process.</li>
	<li>Go to the <strong>HDD/SSD</strong> page and make sure the status of each drive is <strong>Initialized</strong> or <strong>Not Initialized</strong>.</li>
	<li>We recommend using drives in the <a href="https://www.synology.com/compatibility" target=blank>Synology Products Compatibility List</a> to prevent any issues. Using incompatible drives may lower the system performance or even cause data loss on your Synology NAS.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>To create a storage pool:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Open <strong>Storage Manager</strong>.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Storage Pool</strong> and click the <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Choose the storage pool type:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Better performance</strong>: This type of storage pool supports only a single volume but provides better performance.</li>
			<li><strong>Higher flexibility</strong>: This type of storage pool supports multiple volumes, Synology Hybrid RAID (SHR), and the RAID Group feature.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Configure storage pool properties:
		<ul>
			<li>Storage pool description: A description of this storage pool.</li>
			<li>RAID type: Different RAID types offer varying levels of data protection. For more information, please refer to <a href="general.html">General</a>.</li>
			<li>Minimum number of drives per RAID: The minimum number of drives required for the selected RAID Type.</li>
			<li>Maximum number of drives per RAID: A higher number of drives per RAID increases the probability of RAID failure. We recommend adjusting the number limit of drives in a single RAID and using RAID Group to strike a balance between data security and storage pool capacity.</li>
			<li>RAID Group feature: Whether the RAID Group feature is supported by the selected RAID type. While a single RAID has a restriction on the drive number, the RAID Group feature allows your storage block to be composed of multiple RAIDs, thus increasing its capacity and drive redundancy. RAID Group is supported by RAID 5, RAID 6, and RAID F1.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Follow the remaining steps of the wizard to finish creating the storage pool.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>SHR (Synology Hybrid RAID) is available on specific models only. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.synology.com/" target="_blank">Synology website</a>.</li>
	<li>The maximum number of drives per RAID and RAID Group feature are available on specific models only. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.synology.com/" target="_blank">Synology website</a>.</li>
	<li>The maximum number of drives per RAID can be changed only if the selected RAID type supports the RAID Group feature.</li>
	<li>If the RAID type of the storage pool is RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID F1, SHR (above three drives), or SHR-2, the system will perform RAID Resync to the storage pool to enhance access speed and to improve data resilience.</li>
</ul>
