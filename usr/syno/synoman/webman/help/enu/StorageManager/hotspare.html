<h2>Hot Spare</h2>
<p>Hot spare drives are standby drives that can repair a degraded storage pool by automatically replacing a failed drive. Hot spare drives can be globally assigned to protect any storage pool within your Synology NAS, as long as the storage pool matches the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The RAID type of the storage pool must be one with data protection (i.e., RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID 10, and RAID F1</span>).</li>
	<li>The hot spare drive size must be equal to or larger than the size of the smallest drive in the storage pool.</li>
</ul>

<h4>To set up hot spare drives:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
<li>A dialog appears, displaying the hot spare status of each storage pool, as well as available drives. Storage pool status includes the following:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assigned:</strong> The storage pool is protected by at least one assigned hot spare drive.</li>
<li><strong>Available:</strong> There are available drives that can protect the storage pool, but no hot spare has been assigned yet.</li>
<li><strong>Not available:</strong> There are no available hot spare drives that can protect the storage pool.</li>
</ul>
<li>The <strong>Available Drives</strong> section displays drives that can be assigned as hot spare drives. To assign a hot spare drive, tick the box next to the drive you wish to assign as a hot spare.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to save the settings.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4> 
<ul>
<li>When a drive is assigned as a hot spare drive, all the data on the drive will be erased. Before assigning a hot spare drive, make sure the drive has no important data on it.</li>
<li>A RAID assembled by HDDs will not be automatically repaired by SSD hot spare drives and vice versa.</li>
<li>We recommend choosing compatible drives to use as Hot Spare to prevent any issues from occurring to your Synology NAS.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>To configure hot spare settings for a storage pool:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Configure</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Storage Pool</strong> tab, storage pools that can be protected by hot spare drives will be listed. If you untick the boxes, the corresponding storage pools will not be automatically repaired by hot spare drives when degraded.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Cross-device Hot Spare</strong> tab, you can allow hot spare drives on one device to repair a degraded RAID located on a different device.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the settings.</li>
</ol>
